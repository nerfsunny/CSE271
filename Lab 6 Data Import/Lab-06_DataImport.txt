06/16/2015	17:20:00	Weight Lifting	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Lift after work. Usual stuff. Wondering if I should start squatting/lunging heavier and with less reps. Might be more beneficial than high rep low weight.

Prepped my sausage and potatoes, and threw them in the oven before I ran.<br /><br /><br />Did the bus-path to Newington Loop, then randomly around to hit the time. Started off quick, but settled in halfway through. 8 20 second pick-ups in the last 8 minutes for my strides.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

New shoes too. The next few days are going to be rough for running with the car show for my internship. Cannot falter on training however...NO MATTER WHAT 
06/19/2015	21:10:00	Running	5	35:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Worked from 8-6 setting up for the car show at my internship. Absolutely beat, and I had to go to my grandma's for dinner with some of my family. Was a nice time as always. Ran on a near full stomach though. Easy day for the week, but tomorrow may be equally as tiring. 
06/20/2015	19:30:00	Running	8.5	1:00:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Work from 6:30-4:30, the Auto Show for my Internship which is what I have been working doing marketing/advertising for. Big success, nice to see it all come together. Tiring though, and it affected the run. An hour was about as good as I could hope for today. 
06/21/2015	20:00:00	Running	11.3	1:20:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	I thought there was supposed to be a tropical storm today! What happened! I woke up at 5 for no reason, and went back to sleep until 9:30, still having this waking up randomly issue. Ended up having to work LC and I was not happy about that. Went home briefly for father's day...wish I could have spent more than 40 minutes at home. There was literally no one at LC and I was the only game open in the back of the park. Improved my balling skills however, can now do layups and shoot better from close range. Watch out.<br /><br /><br />Got my break at 6:00, and they let me leave right after so I was able to eat. Ran after getting home and relaxing for a bit. Still tired from all this, but better than the past 2 days.<br /><br /><br />Got my fleet feet schedule. Averaging around 25 hours a week there. If I don't get the small internship I applied for I'll be staying at LC all summer too. I hit 59 hours of work this week. Lets hope I never do that again in my life. Planning to start doubles this week.

They crossed the road from SQP and I went back down to the pond to meet Alex. Did the rest of the run with him at AW.<br /><br /><br />8 strides with him on Oak St.<br /><br /><br />Faster pace for the run, and my legs felt good today, despite another day working outside for the most part.<br /><br /><br />Finished my internship, just have to go back one morning to talk about everything. I'm going to miss some of these people. I get along with one of the guys really well, and everyone there is really pleasant to work with. Will be nice to have my schedule a little more varied so I can introduce doubles. Getting up to run at 7:00 before I start at Fleet Feet. 
06/23/2015	00:00:00	Running	10.5	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Good stuff, fast (6:00 pace or so), felt good for early morning. Started with Joe, Kevin, Alex, and Dave. Joe was going short and split off, then Kevin dropped on the AW hill, Dave was on and off, and Alex was with me the whole time. He likes this fast stuff. 
06/23/2015	16:45:00	Weight Lifting	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Lift after Fleet Feet. I like it.

06/26/2015	07:10:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Ran to pick up Joe, then ran 30 minutes with him. Finished alone on the bus path and in SQP.Felt alright today.<br /><br /><br />Spent like 45 minutes on the phone trying to figure out next year. Looks like I'm going to take 3 undergrad classes to fill prereqs, and 1 grad marketing course to start the core courses. Need to register soon.<br /><br /><br />Got to try on a ton of shoes at Fleet Feet. I want a pair of Adidas Boost! So bouncy and light! Apparently the boost foam can last thousands of miles too.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Dropped back with Kev because my legs weren't warmed up (we were still under 7:00 pace though). Joe and Pat split off at AW where I linked back with Dave and Alex and dropped Kev as we picked the pace up. I felt good from this point forward. Need to get my sleep up.<br /><br /><br />Breaking News: My Dad got a job in SC so hes moving at the end of the month with my Mom and brother to follow by the Fall when they close on a house and sell ours. Just hit me that this is actually happening. Going to much different without them 20 minutes away. Life.

When I was finishing some guy was apparently angry at my choice of only running shorts saying, Put some fucking clothes on, no one wants to see that shit, slowing his car down to a stop sign. I fired back some vulgar comments, and he repeated his comments.Wow.

07/03/2015	08:15:00	Running	13	1:30:00.00	Long Run 	Workout			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	8:15 officially feels late for a run. I'm on the right track. Felt decent. Down around willow brook area and back to finish around SQP. Getting this out of the way early because 4th of July weekend will be busy.

07/06/2015	13:20:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	After a lot of organizing of my room, integrating all my things from home into my current room at Oak St, and finding where to store the rest.<br /><br /><br />Felt ok. Legs are always somewhat tired.<br /><br /><br />Got full acceptance to grad school so that's a weight off my shoulders, and finalized my class schedule. 
07/06/2015	21:30:00	Running	5	35:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	With Pat after I got home from work at LC. 
07/07/2015	10:00:00	Weight Lifting	0	50:00.00		Training					Lift/core. Weighed in at work at 139.6. Down 2.5 pounds from before I started running, which is a good thing. 
07/07/2015	20:00:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	WML with Pat and then SQP-Barbour Rd. Right posterior tibial tendon was sore today. Hate when that happens. 
07/08/2015	07:15:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Awful. Legs were having no part of this, was a struggle to finish, and hold any kind of pace. Tibial tendon was sore again too. Time to recover a bit...well after this 11 hour work day I have coming up anyway. 
07/09/2015	17:30:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	After work from Fleet Feet before our store meeting. This job is awesome. Ran 2 miles up the road to the WHR and did trails in there. Started moving the second half. Slept 8 hours last night, and stayed in bed an extra hour. Also rolled my legs and tibial tendon a lot at work which really helped, pain was not a factor today. 
07/10/2015	11:00:00	Running	5	35:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0		Today was supposed to be a double day, but I ended up staying at LC until midnight. Ridiculous. Will double Sunday and do my long run tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />Ran in my store shoes (Brooks Launch 2) and they felt amazing. I'll stick to my Mizunos until they wear out. 
07/11/2015	19:00:00	Running	15	1:45:00.00	Long Run 	Workout			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	After work and some food. Downtown New Britain to Slater Batterson, some random neighborhoods, and SQP. They are making the path wider at SQP and adding new paths from the pond to the road. Going to make Ted Owen and workouts better for sure. Felt decent today, thought the length of the run was tiring me out towards the end. 
07/12/2015	13:00:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Heat of the day. Felt decent. Didn't double because work after this exhausted me. 
07/13/2015	23:00:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Felt good on this night run. Quick for the most part, and definitely sub 6 for about 10 minutes at the end.<br /><br /><br />On East St I had a water bottle thrown at me, and near AW a girl stepped in front of me in the road, grunted, and swung at me. That was one of my weirdest night run encounters for sure. 
07/14/2015	11:45:00	Running	5	35:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Before work after hitting the bank and grocery shopping. Not sure if I need down time, or if I'm just used to being busy everyday. I think a day off to relax would be helpful though. I really like Fleet Feet days though. Its the Lake Compounce days I don't like so much. All for the sake of filling my bank account! 
07/14/2015	21:50:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	After work and cooking up some dinner to last a few days. Felt good. Normal night route, no exploring tonight.

07/15/2015	20:15:00	Running	5	35:00.00	Strides 	Workout			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Met Alex at the park and ran into Pat. Did 8 strides on Oak with Alex, then added a mile to finish the run. Felt good here. Work got canceled due to rain and I had the day to spend home which was so nice. My Dad moves to South Carolina next Saturday and I won't see him until Xmas break. Hope to get home again next week sometime. 
07/16/2015	22:30:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	With Ryan, so nice not being alone, and we were on the faster side, but that's not a surprise. Usual night time out and back. 
07/17/2015	10:45:00	Running	6.4	45:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Night run and easy day. Ended up talking to Joe and Dave for a while and ran late. Felt decent. Saw a rabbit with its midsection ripped open crawling in the road, must've got hit by a car. This threw me off for sure, not a pleasant sight. Ran back that way and saw a small rabbit sitting next to the road. It ran away as I got close. Saw the rabbit from earlier smeared in the road. How sad. 
07/18/2015	18:30:00	Running	11	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics DS Trainer 19 (05/01/2015)	Alright, we are in better shape than I thought, but that's nothing unusual. Did 25 min then stopped to stretch. Felt way better after this. Went to the track to start the fast finish. The gate was closed but I slid under the low corner...your fence is no match for how skinny I am! Started out at what I assumed was like high 5 min pace, but in reality I hit a 5:18. Never really lost that pace other than on hills. Felt good for being alone. We are set. Long run tomorrow will put me over 80 miles. Probably max out around 90 running miles this summer. No need to push the boundaries. 
07/19/2015	13:00:00	Running	15	1:45:00.00	Long Run 	Workout			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Didn't feel good at all today. Pat Joined for the last 45 minutes or so which pulled me through. Been really thinking about training today. I need to start putting running before everything so I can get the most out of these last 5 weeks of training. I'm obviously not in bad shape, but if I can rid myself of this fatigue I can get higher quality runs in. Over 80 this week, and I'd like to be around 90 for the next week. After that I will hopefully get in some elliptical time because approaching 100 miles per week doesn't do me any good. 
07/20/2015	13:30:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	SQP-AW in the heat, which really was no issue for me. Slept in and relaxed this morning since I worked an evening shift. Just what I needed.<br /><br /><br />Need to shake this fatigue! Not worrying about pace for now, just need to get my legs back under me feeling good. No spring in my step these days.<br /><br /><br /><br />
07/20/2015	21:30:00	Running	5	35:00.00	Strides 	Workout			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Nice comfortable run. Remembered what running comfortably actually is, same thing as running relaxed in a race, zoning out and getting into a rhythm.<br /><br /><br />Oak St strides. 
07/21/2015	17:00:00	Weight Lifting	0	50:00.00		Training					Lift/core. Body was kind of tired here. 
07/21/2015	18:30:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Was going to run with Dave this morning, but LC called and said if I covered a morning shift I wouldn't have to work at night as I was supposed to so I jumped on that. Ran later. Decent beginning, not so great middle, decent end. Ran on the golf course. They added 1 or 2 holes.<br /><br /><br />Been taking supplements again. Iron and fish oil in the morning, D3, Magnesium Zinc, and B12 at night.

07/23/2015	07:15:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Early run with Ryan, Dave, and Jason. Quicker but not super fast. Fatigue was hitting me hard on this one.<br /><br /><br />Decided to quit Lake Compounce I need time to rest and recover. About a month out from preseason and my last shift should be July 31st. Some rest will put me right into awesome shape and ready to go for cross. I'm hungry, but also fed up with feeling like trash. 
07/24/2015	17:15:00	Running	10	1:10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0		Tried to do a fartlek but was dieing hard halfway through so I stopped. Felt like I had ran a 10k after this. Entire body was cooked. Worst I've felt this summer I think. Taking tomorrow off. A little rest and my legs will be back, underneath this sea of fatigue are some fast strong legs.

Joe went short and me Alex and Jason stayed at AW and did a WML. Jason dropped part way through. Breathing is good. Leg fatigue was still there but not as bad. Just wait until these legs start getting good rest...<br /><br /><br />8 strides on Oak with Alex

07/31/2015	08:00:00	Running	6.9	46:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Mizuno Wave Paradox (06/18/2015)	Easy day because I worked just shy of 12 hours today. Bitter sweet goodbyes at LC, but a smart move none the less.<br /><br /><br />Ran to SQP, then to the track where I saw Malcolm and jumped in on his tempo for about a mile. 5:30 pace ish. Not ideal for a recovery day, but whatever. Felt good today.<br /><br /><br />Got my new shoes from Fleet Feet. Asics Gel-Pursue 2. Can't wait to give them a try tomorrow.

Ran around SQP for 45 minutes where I ran into Austin and Tori, then went to the golf course and back to Oak St for strides, which felt strong and fast. Overall felt good today, definitely feel the long run, but my legs don't feel heavy and bogged down. This is what I like to see.

Started at a good pace, but then Alex and Dave began to hammer so I dropped back with Kev and Joe. Finished with Kev. Felt good honestly, just didn't feel like killing the pace. Not a fan of having Garmins around while running. So inaccurate when trail running. I prefer going off feel.

Kept getting the urge to push the pace, but tried not to since I knew it wouldn't do me much good. Ran from Oak to Walnut (20 min) around Walnut a bunch of times (40 min) back toward school (20 min) modified WML (40 min). Was at 6:30 pace at about 30 minutes in, but eased up on that a bit later. First week over 90 in a LOOOONNNNGGGG time.

Also did some foam rolling.<br /><br /><br />Colin came over today and I decided to join him and Brendan at some trails in Manchester. Nice relaxing pace. Definitely feel the 2 hours of road I did yesterday. Found out Colin did his 2 hour long run at 8:00 in NB just like I did, only we did it in different parts of NB. Too bad we didn't run together.<br /><br /><br />Got smoothies at Evergreen Walk after which hit the spot.

We were definitely at 6:12-6:30 pace at the track (which was lit up past 9 for some reason, but then it kept saying we were going slower than 7:10 pace which was complete BS. I'm good at judging pace and we were at least running 6:45 after this bare minimum. Good stuff regardless.

Warmed up 20, stretched briefly, then started around Batterson lake. Legs were heavy to start and didn't really warm up until the last 3rd of this. Ryan was ahead on all other than the first 2 min rep, and the last 4-3-2. Happy with this though, will be ready for preseason with a little rest next week.

Typical slow start, but picked up a lot before Res 6 and kept fast.Was going to go longer to try and hit 90 again, but that would be pointless. 1 week until preseason!

It has been rare that my legs want to move when I run alone. Great down week only 10 miles under my highest week so no peaking for the time trial for this guy.

Took it a little shorter today just because preseason will be hard and make up for any mileage loss from today. Lets get this rolling.

Started out 5:28 for mile 1 with Alex, Brendan, Colin, and Ryan. Then by mile 3 it was just me and Ryan with Brendan and Colin close behind. Came through 5 with Ryan at 27:18 or so. Felt the best I ever have on the turn around. Led from this point and tried to keep Ryan with me but he fell back as Colin caught up at mile 6.5. Then it was me and Colin for the rest and we finished together.Definitely feel the run right now, but it was pretty relaxed overall I'd say. Not dead afterwards by any means. Onward with preseason.

Not a big fan though there may have been more trail I had missed. Not feeling too bad from the time trial, some pain in the outside of my lower right leg though. Obviously has me paranoid since I just had a stress fracture.

08/27/2015	16:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					Not doubling anymore this week. Xtraining instead since I'll still be around 90 running miles. Drenched in sweat after this. HR got up to high 150's.

08/28/2015	16:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					Elliptical after the team meeting. Heart rate in the high 150s. Super pumped after the meeting, ready to get some good training in and kill it this season.

Really putting this in perspective, never in my life will I have these experiences again. Went well overall though I died hard at the Mtn. Quick pace to start and kept pushing. Felt great other than some tightness and weirdness in the leg again. Colin felt great and when he wanted to start cruising after the mall I went with him. I fell back on him when we hit the mountain which we must have been sub 5:30 at this point or so. Caught up over the rolling hills, then he kicked my ass up the Mtn. I was over a minute slower up the mountain than last year. Took about 10:30 as opposed to 8:40. Overall though I was 01:40:30 to the top. Colin was a minute ahead, then I was followed by Tyler, Ryan, and Alex from my group. Lets go, just got to make sure my leg stays fine. Taking no chances with this shit. 
08/31/2015	06:30:00	Weight Lifting	0	30:00.00		Training					Distance lift session 1/2. Decent stuff. Leg was hurting this morning. 
08/31/2015	07:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					Had to go all the way to the new dorm for this. 
08/31/2015	15:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:10:00.00		Training					Long session. Went to the trainers before this for well over an hour. They figure it is the muscles on the outside of my leg. Foam rolled good, then got a massage up and down the outside of the leg which was actually legit. Girl had some skills. Being proactive and jumping on this before it gets any worse. Rolled out with a field hockey ball and foam roller in the evening after dinner. See how it feels tomorrow. Told myself I'd give it another day of X-training if needed. Staying healthy is the name of the game. 
09/01/2015	09:30:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					Leg is better today I believe, just sore from the mix of massage, field hockey ball, and foam roller. Slept in compression socks too. Cage forgot to wash our clothes last night, so I had to go back home for clothes after my 8am class. 
09/01/2015	10:15:00	Weight Lifting	0	45:00.00		Training					Changed my sweat-rag of a shirt after the elliptical and came back to get my lifting schedule back on track. Didn't do lat pull downs because we did it in lift yesterday.<br /><br /><br />Hit up the trainers again. Heated, got a lighter version of the massage I had yesterday, did the slant board, foam rolled, and got heel lifts. I'm actually pleased with the trainers, I will keep going. MAY run a bit today just to test the leg.

09/01/2015	15:50:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	55:00.00		Training					Switched it up. Leg didn't feel right. This better not be an issue. 
09/02/2015	06:30:00	Weight Lifting	0	30:00.00		Training					Distance lift. Did everything but weighted lunges because my leg wasn't feeling it. 
09/02/2015	07:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					Typical stuff after distance lift...the last one 
09/02/2015	14:00:00	Weight Lifting	0	45:00.00		Training					Lift/core with Tyler and Kyle, though I did my own thing. Get ripped! 
09/02/2015	15:15:00	Spinning	0	1:10:00.00		Training					Missed van day for this. Got pretty pissed and decided to do a workout. Did 20 min warm-up, 10x2 min hard 1 min easy. Got the HR above 150 briefly, but it took a lot of effort to get that. So much sweat.<br /><br /><br />Hoping whatever is wrong with my leg is either some muscular strain or a mild stress reaction. Neither of which should sideline me for long. Going to be more conservative once I get this better. The potential is there... 
09/03/2015	09:50:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					First elliptical of the day. HR above 160. 
09/03/2015	10:30:00	Core	0	20:00.00		Training					Quick core session 
09/03/2015	15:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:10:00.00		Training					Elliptical 2...may be getting better. Tomorrow will be the real test.

Went out 40 min with Alex, and did a fast finish in 33:30 alone, which I figure equates to something like 5:35 pace based on the pace we were hitting for the first 40 minutes, which for me and Alex, had to be around 6:30. Added on a few minutes after at a normal pace. Leg felt the best it has. Definitely better than yesterday.

Leg bothered me a little, and the 5 days off followed by a fast finish got me a bit sore. The pace felt comfortable, just my legs weren't 100% in it. Fell off Ryan a few times, also had no speed on the 30 seconds. Sounds like I'm disappointed but I'm not at all. These are minor gripes.<br /><br /><br />Side note...I love going to the trainers right now. They are doing great on my leg.<br /><br /><br />The work continues! 
09/09/2015	07:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					Elliptical before team core, leg doesn't feel good this morning.

Everyone passed me while I stretched, but when I came back I was pushing the pace and passed people (not that this matters, but that's what happened)Felt best at 60 minutes...go figure. Now at night after the run my leg feels great, what gives? 
09/10/2015	15:30:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Leg killed today when I tried to run. Sucks...but it is what it is. Worst comes to worst I'll see the doctor Monday and get some good anti-inflammatory meds or something. 
09/11/2015	08:45:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Elliptical again. Leg does feel somewhat better today. Taking Naproxen Sodium (Aleve) to see if it helps. Rolling and massaging my leg as much as possible at work.

Not terrible either.<br /><br /><br />Part 1: Loops of the course at Bryant with Eric for 35+ minutes. Leg was hurting, but got a bit better towards the end. Coach Ray showed me a new stretch prior which I will start doing.<br /><br /><br />Part 2: Sprinting all over the course to cheer which I will call 5 min of running. Leg was better during all this. Good race for the boys today. I see you Sean Ferguson...<br /><br /><br />Part 3: 20 min CD with Alex. Leg was feeling ok, still not right, but less painful.<br /><br /><br />We will see what happens tomorrow. Hoping to get in a good fast finish 90 min. I'm feeling ready to destroy a run right about now.

Struggled to make it out 35 minutes, which in retrospect wasn't worth it. Tried to fast finish back, but my leg was hurting a decent amount so I slowed down. I think this affects my stride being that my left quad gets more tired than anything. Was absolutely furious about this. Should see the doc tomorrow, see whats up. I worked hard so I wouldn't get hurt...

09/14/2015	16:15:00	Spinning	0	15:00.00		Training					Switched from elliptical. Saw Waskowtiz and he is ordering me an MRI to make sure I don't have an SFX. I'm pretty optimistic here though. My attitude is that it is what it is and we'll deal with it accordingly. After whatever this is I'm switching stuff up because I'm sick of these injuries... 
09/15/2015	15:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:15:00.00		Training					Getting an MRI Thursday night so we will know whats up. Went to the trainers this morning and got a massage on the back of my calf instead of the outside of my leg. Super tight there and the girl does a real good job on the massages. Hurt like a bitch. Its 7:30pm and the area is still sore to touch. Maybe this will help?<br /><br /><br />Did almost the same fartlek as the team. 5x6 min hard, 1 min easy. 20 min WU/CD. HR 143 on WU, 184 during, 133 CD (Max for WU and during, average time on CD). Super hard effort, soaked the machine and the floor. 
09/16/2015	08:15:00	Callisthenics	0	20:00.00		Training					So we had some painting done in the house yesterday, and it was setting of the fire alarm (carbon monoxide). It stopped, but started going off at 1:30 AM...thought it was my alarm and that it was 7:30. Went off like 2 more times. Slept through 7:40 core and did it myself. My bad. 
09/16/2015	12:00:00	Pool Running	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Joined Blake for a pool workout. Basically same as yesterday.<br /><br /><br />13 min WU, 6x5 min hard 1 min easy, 4x1 min hard 1 min easy, 3 min CD. 1 hour of work so I'll do 45 elliptical at least during practice. Getting in that work, and honestly I'm really not worried about my fitness. Missing a full week but doing high intensity will keep my cardio solid, maybe even boost it? I'll then ease back to mileage in the 70s and stay there...have some killer workouts too. Reminder to myself...I still was sub 9:00 and sub 15:30 off some of the worst training I've ever had, and with a stress fracture on top of it. How bad do you want it? 
09/16/2015	15:20:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	45:00.00		Training					Did 45 to make it to 01:45:00 for the day since pool running was only 1 hour. Heart rate was 145-151 from times I took it. 
09/16/2015	16:15:00	Weight Lifting	0	35:00.00		Training					Lifted arms and shoulders since I had time to kill 
09/17/2015	15:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:10:00.00		Training					Fartlek round 3. Really trying to get that work in as much as possible. 10x2 min hard 1 min easy. HR mainly in the 170s, and I got into the 180s for the last rep.<br /><br /><br />Got my MRI, though Waskowitz ordered it for my knee which I don't get because its my shin that hurts. Whatever, hes an expert. Leg was painless walking around today. 
09/18/2015	09:50:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Watched the tempo this morning, some good runs.<br /><br /><br />FUCK THIS, was just really angry to be back here, and my leg hurts in general today. I swear if the wrong MRI got ordered I'm gonna be pissed.<br /><br /><br />Anyways...went for day 4 of fartleks and think I hit the end. I got through 6x3min hard 1 min easy and my body wasn't feeling it. Got the HR into the high 170s though.<br /><br /><br /><br />
09/20/2015	08:30:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:30:00.00		Training					Elliptical while the team ran long of campus. Did some 8-10 min pickups sporadically. Hit the treadmill twice. Once before the Elliptical, once after. Leg pain still there.

09/21/2015	11:45:00	Pool Running	0	1:00:00.00		Training					With Blake and Brendan joined part way in. 5x3,2,1 with 1 min rest between each. 13 min WU/2 min CD. 
09/21/2015	15:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	45:00.00		Training					Elliptical, standard. Got my MRI results checked. No SFX! Mild stress reactions above and below my knee, but nothing terrible. Just have to be careful raising mileage. Back in the game and so pumped! Hopefully running works out. 
09/21/2015	16:15:00	Weight Lifting	0	40:00.00		Training					Chest, back, and shoulders

09/22/2015	09:45:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Long workout for the day. Will do 5-6 miles later running. Hoping for the best!

Feel like I'm in good shape though, just need to shake the injury. If nothing else, I'll have a lot of aggression to release the first time I race.<br /><br /><br />Starting Coach Ray's leg strengthening stuff, and will wear a strassburg sock. Probably going to some compression socks too. 
09/24/2015	15:25:00	Running	1.5	10:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue 2 (07/31/2015)	With Colin on the track. Leg was pretty bad. Slight limp. Started ultrasound at the trainers along with all the other stuff. New plan. Take 2 weeks just xtraining, come back for NECs to race. Things are not going my way, but hey, just need to stay motivated which is no issue. 
09/24/2015	15:45:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Farlek time baby! 8 x 4 min hard 1 min easy. 10 min WU/ 10 min CD. Hard, got the HR to mid 180s. 
09/25/2015	09:30:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:12:00.00		Training					Starting on the plan Blake gave me for the next 10 days. Nice to have structure.<br /><br /><br />15 min WU<br />3 x 12 min hard 2 min easy<br />15 min CD<br /><br /><br />Probably a little tired from yesterdays fartlek, but floated around 165-175 for this. 
09/26/2015	00:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	2:00:00.00		Training					Finally got back on my log through a letsrun hack. Not going through the trouble of logging everything so just gonna put in times for stuff

10/12/2015	07:45:00	Core	0	15:00.00		Training					Caught back up on my log so here is brief synopsis of what has been going on the last 2 weeks I missed logging or so (for those who care to read). Been doing doubles basically everyday. Mix of pool/elliptical/bike. Did about 5 workouts each week getting the HR above 170. Got it above that on some normal days too. Feel like I'm in great cardio shape, and I am super confident. All I need is a good pain free 30 min run later and I'm good to go. Need to get this team back on track, its hard to be a good leader when I'm not working with the team. 
10/12/2015	15:15:00	Running	4.5	30:00.00	Strides 	Workout			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	No pain, just a mild sensation. Not bad. Little sore in the groin/hip flexors, but that was expected. Excited for my new training plan!<br /><br /><br />8 strides 
10/12/2015	16:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Immediately following the run. Got the HR above 170 again. Took it down the last 10 min or so.<br /><br /><br />Been keeping up on my leg exercises, tube stretching, foam rolling, etc. Also getting supplementation on track. Sleep is a little off because I am so swamped with school. 
10/13/2015	09:30:00	Running	3	20:15.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Football field loops. Mild discomfort. I keep expecting to start the run and have sharp pains just because that's what I'd gotten used to. We will see how the later run goes. 
10/13/2015	10:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					Immediately following the run. Was really hungry, will do another 30 this afternoon. 
10/13/2015	15:15:00	Running	3.5	25:00.00	Strides 	Workout			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	More aggravated then yesterday's afternoon run. Still not enough to hinder me however. Keeps me super paranoid.<br /><br /><br />8 strides 
10/13/2015	16:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					HR high 160's. Did 15 min forward, 15 min backwards. 
10/14/2015	07:45:00	Core	0	15:00.00		Training					Team core with a small group...hmmmm.<br /><br /><br />On another note I'm glad to be back out here for another reason. So I can call people out for bullshitting around. 
10/14/2015	10:30:00	Running	3	20:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Been super nervous all morning due to a dull ache in my leg. Finally got myself to do the run and no pain. What? Better than yesterday, and at least as good as the first run back. Sore from getting back into running but I don't care about that. More achy after, but we will see how the later run goes. Discomfort is dull not sharp btw. Kind of excited to tempo Friday, though it may kick my ass. Really want to see what all this intense cross training will give me as far as running return. 
10/14/2015	15:15:00	Running	3	20:00.00	Strides 	Workout			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	SQP-Track with Colin and Ryan. Leg discomfort was elevated fro sure, but not bad. Sore, but not fatigued, as you'd expect.<br /><br /><br />6 100m strides and a 200 to close off. Hit 14mid for all 6, and 30.1 in the 200 which didn't feel new. Little things like this just boost my confidence. 
10/14/2015	16:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:00:00.00		Training					After run #2. Feeling a bit more tired here so kept the HR in the 140's. Did 45 forward, 15 backwards. 
10/15/2015	10:00:00	Running	4	27:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	After my accounting exam which I think I did great on. Honestly went into this thinking I'd be hurting today, but this was one of the most normal feeling runs I've had. Discomfort wasn't even elevated at all after. Accidentally went 7 min longer than planned, woops. 
10/15/2015	15:15:00	Running	4	28:00.00	Strides 	Workout			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Started out quick with Ryan. 6:30 or so first mile. Legs still feeling good, and this was also the most normal feeling run yet, until after strides where I felt some discomfort again. 2 x 2 mile tomorrow, time to solidify what I am thinking, that I am in good shape still.<br /><br /><br />8 strides at SQP 
10/15/2015	16:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	50:00.00		Training					After run #2. HR around 150 average. Brief period of 170s, but wasn't feeling it. 
10/16/2015	00:00:00	Running	4.5	00.00	2 x 2 mile 	Workout			0		Very happy with this. Honestly felt only a bit rusty, but very fit. Unfortunately Colin had to stop, he did a 2 mile before I started and his groin was killing him so I did the last 2 on my own. Ran 10:04 for the first 2 mile though I assumed I'd be slow. Felt pretty good and ran 9:48 for the next one, which also felt good.<br /><br /><br />This really makes me want to get in the mini meet. 
10/16/2015	06:25:00	Running	5	35:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	WU/CD. Short warm-up to be sure not to over do it on the leg, but I felt pretty good actually. 
10/17/2015	18:15:00	Running	3	20:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Should have run before work but whatever. Happy to say this was the first pain free run I've had, and the discomfort following was less intense and more brief than it has been. This is good news. Calves are sooo sore, but I'll take it! Once I get through this phase we are good to go! 
10/18/2015	08:15:00	Running	7.5	45:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Farmington Rail Trail with Joe, Alex, Kevin, Kyle, and Austin. Pace picked up as we went and the group strung out at the cornfield. Joe said around 20 min we were at 5:50 pace. Caught up to Alex, and then we let Joe catch back up to decide where to run. I then pushed the pace alone on the way back, I figure since I'm only doing 45 might as well get some speed going. No leg pain, discomfort after is very mild. Legs are pretty sore.<br /><br /><br />Stretch and dynamics after.<br /><br /><br />As good of a first week back as I could have hoped for! What will week 2 bring? 
10/19/2015	07:15:00	Running	3	22:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Alone to SQP and joined the group on the way back. Legs are kind of sore.

10/19/2015	15:45:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	45:00.00		Training					Easy 
10/20/2015	00:00:00	Running	5.5	40:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Fast WU/ Slow CD 
10/20/2015	00:00:00	Running	4	00.00	4 x 1 mile 	Workout			0		Everything I could have wanted, don't sleep on me. Confidence at an all time high, legs pretty sore all around. Went into this knowing I could do 3 if I wanted and with the goal of feeling comfortable.<br /><br /><br />Rep 1: 4:43. Went out relaxed and finished relaxed, sore hamstrings and I feel like I can't reach top speed. Breathing was super easy.<br />Rep 2: 4:44. Again felt relaxed, little harder and was feeling my legs.<br />Rep 3: 4:39. Better than the first 2. Asserted myself and pushed out a bit from the start. Sub 4:40?! Thinking to myself, No way after 3+ weeks of no running am I feeling this good<br />Rep 4: 4:38. Knew I didn't have to do this and considered stopping to take impact off the leg, but I wanted to do it and was confident. Feeling a little more at the end of this, but still not bad!<br /><br /><br />Got to get that rest. Good chance I'll run a conservative mini meet Friday. Let's go! 
10/21/2015	10:30:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	50:00.00		Training					8 hours of sleep plus 1.5 more hours in bed. So nice. HR in 140s for this. 
10/21/2015	15:15:00	Running	5.5	37:44.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	At the Apple Orchard. Went longer than planned, as I brought Joe and Blake to the Southington Open Space trails which were really nice, highschool throwback. Leg discomfort is elevated. 
10/22/2015	15:15:00	Running	3	21:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Leg bothering me today not going to lie. Only did 2 strides because of that. Pumped to race tomorrow. 
10/23/2015	00:00:00	Running	6	40:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Fast WU. Normal pace CD. Inner shin hurts, but good otherwise. 
10/23/2015	15:30:00	Running	3.11	15:19.00	Competition 	Competition	CCSU Mini Meet	5K Cross Country	9		Proved to myself I still got it! Plan was to go out super relaxed which I did. Everyone jumped off the line, while I went out in almost last place feeling nice. Moved up behind Malcolm as we hit the tennis courts and after we came down around the pond I moved up a little, still pretty far back though. On loop 2 I moved up past tons of people and sat with a group behind Ryan and Joe. Held tight in here, and we made up a lot of ground on the front. I had no closing speed, but I know I could've gone way harder if I treated this as a real race. Feels great to be back. NECs baby! All I have to say... 
10/24/2015	08:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	50:00.00		Training					Elliptical, HR in the 160s. Inner shin was super sore this morning so playing it safe. 
10/25/2015	10:00:00	Running	3	20:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	With Tyler. My leg hurt so I decided to only do 1 run rather than 2. Was going to do another once I got home, but Kevin reminded me of what I told him once. Its not worth running if it will only hurt you. 
10/26/2015	09:00:00	Running	3	20:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Leg was bothering me on both sides 
10/26/2015	15:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:00:00.00		Training					Instead of running. HR hit 160s but reduced to 140s the last 25 minutes. 5 days out #BeReady 
10/27/2015	15:15:00	Running	3	20:00.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Warm up with the team, leg wasn't feeling good on the outside. Inside wasn't sore however so that's a plus. The one part of the weekend that I'm pumped for is the mental aspect. If I get anything out of this it can be to get myself mentally sharper than I've ever been, which is huge. 
10/27/2015	15:40:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:04:00.00		Training					Did my workout here instead which was a good move. 6 x 3 min hard 1 min easy, 4 x 30 seconds. No obligation tomorrow morning, and my Thursday morning class got canceled. SLEEP! 
10/28/2015	15:30:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	45:00.00		Training					Was in the mood to just crush this and hit 160's pretty quick, but decided to chill since NECs is this weekend. Leg doesn't feel good, but I don't give a shit about that. Been visualizing the entire race over and over, different scenarios, and how I will mentally react when the going gets tough, which it most definitely will. I am a firm believer that you can train your brain to push harder if you prepare, after all, your brain is like a governor on a car during a race, just preventing you from going faster even though your body is fully capable of going harder. 
10/29/2015	15:45:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					A little elliptical action 
10/30/2015	14:15:00	Running	4.8	31:20.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	Asics Gel-Pursue (10/12/2015)	Around the course quick with Ryan. Never been so nerve racked for a race in my life.

10/31/2015	11:00:00	Running	4.98	25:17.00	Competition 	Competition	Northeast Conference Championship	8K Cross Country	5		Well there you have it. I'll say I gave it my best go, and I really shouldn't be too disappointed. Kept myself in very respectable shape off like 80% cross training, this was technically a PR. Went out hard with Ryan, I REALLY REALLY wanted to win. Couldn't hold the pace and fell back to the group of Ferg, Gooding, and Bryce England. Held on and tried to get Gooding, but I couldn't kick on him. Finished and it hit me, this is it, no more chances, its over, and honestly I was a bit sad. I'm not one to get all caught up in that kind of thing though and was fine with it afterwards. We got #7, and the girls got 2nd place which was honestly pretty exciting to see.<br /><br /><br />Not running regionals, just want to get healthy. Also a bit of a bummer, but a smart move none the less. I am capable of big things, I know that, and this mess of a season proves it. I mean I ran 25:17 off almost nothing, that excites me! Just need to actually run and I will attain all my track goals. So hungry for more! The break between Cross and Indoor will feel like an eternity, but it gives me the chance to really work on getting myself ready for PRs from the mile up to the 10k. This year I am for once not dreading the mile, and actually want to knock out my slow 4:26 PR from 2 years ago.<br /><br /><br />Less than 2 weeks until the regional. I'll put all my energy into cheering for that one. 
11/01/2015	00:00:00	Weight Lifting	0	40:00.00		Training					Lift/core. Would like to get back into this again. 
11/01/2015	08:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	45:00.00		Training					Legs were feeling the race a bit, so just chilled. 
11/02/2015	15:45:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	50:00.00		Training					Got the HR up to 170 for a bit, but wasn't feeing it so stayed in the 150's. Feeling the weekend a bit still.<br /><br /><br />Had our team meeting. Definitely sucks to not be able to do regionals, but thinking ahead, if I'm going to hit all my big goals, I need to start prepping now. All eyes on January. 
11/03/2015	15:15:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	55:00.00		Training					15 min WU, 10 x 2 min hard 1 min easy, 10 min CD<br /><br /><br />HR in the low 170's max. I can't go easy, I just feel the need to work. Will probably start back with elliptical doubles next week, just keep it relativity short this week for some semblance of a rest week, though I have no desire to rest. I can't wait to be in good shape and able to run the times I know I am capable of. That's when I feel all around the best. Junior year 2nd semester was such a great time, especially during that outdoor season. Everything was great. 
11/03/2015	16:15:00	Weight Lifting	0	30:00.00		Training					Had some extra time. Did core and lifted biceps, triceps, and forearms. Withdrew from a class so now I only have class on Tuesday and Wednesday night. Recovery is going to be on point, hopefully I will be able to start putting in that work after these 2 weeks.

I didn't go there knowing this, but it seems they have finally started to connect both towns bike paths. I ran out on the path where all the brush has finally been cleared for 22 min. It started off terrible and rocky, but got smoother as it went, and once crossing a street was paved dirt which was the nicest running surface I've had in a while. I turned around due to construction vehicles blocking the path, and not wanting to get kicked off. Its about time.

Love running with all the Palmetto trees and Spanish Moss, feels so tropical. I would 100% live here if I had friends here,and could have a social life. Also not too sure about the job market. Great place to live when you are all settled/retired for sure.

I'm going to try to get up early tomorrow, maybe catch the sunrise and read part of a book I got as a gift. We'll see if I can actually get up.

Kevin started slower, and I picked him up at about 50 min, then we turned and I actually felt good and decided to fast finish back. Pace for this was about 6 flat if not a little faster.

This works well.<br /><br /><br />Splits:1:47,1:48,1:49,1:50,1:48,1:50,1:47,1:50,1:47,1:48...Total time 26:26.<br /><br /><br />Next up was a 1000 inside at 3k pace. Ran a 2:49 and felt good. Just imagining doing this for a 5k...oh baby.<br /><br /><br />4x200 to finish. Ran 31,32,31,29 low<br /><br /><br />Calves feel tight and tired, but overall feeling strong. Wouldn't expect to feel on top or that would mean I'm not training well enough. Will see what I can do in the 3k on Saturday, but the BU 5k is the real goal for now.<br /><br />

Started in back, moved to 2nd, hung on UCONN until about 1900m, then took the lead with 1 kid following who eventually dropped. Am I happy about this race? Not overly, the time was way slower than I believe it should be, though I should have been in a better heat. I beat a bunch of slow kids, big deal. I wasn't even mentally as strong as I've been either. I just know I'm capable of better, and have to hold myself to certain standards that's all. 2 weeks until the BU 5k...no screwing around here.

Breathing is amazingly smooth, could've held a conversation during this probably, but the legs are just on empty right now. Went out slow at 5:47 with the group. Took the lead at the 2.5 mile turn around which was like 13:57 which again was slow, and we picked up. Fell off the group about a half to a full mile later. Then in the last mile I told my self I wasn't going to finish behind everyone, so I picked up and passed all but Tyler. This just makes me a bit angry because this pace should be a joke to me right now, I should be easily a full minute faster bare minimum. Oh well, I'm going to stop killing myself and get the legs back. This was overall a bad week, and my races have been very sub-par as well.

01/25/2016	09:30:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	30:00.00		Training					HR 150 or so...done with the hard efforts for now as they may not be helping as much as I hoped. All I can say is, I believe I am going to feel good today on the run, but we will find out later.

Legs felt better as we went. Seeded at 14:20 for the weekend, and I have a confidence about myself I have been lacking. I just need to feel smooth and controlled on the workout tomorrow, and I'll be all set. Haven't anticipated a race this much in a while either.

Legs really are coming back. The 67.8 rep I lead felt the smoothest of all nicely enough. After a nice easy 3 days I think I'll be ready for something I can be proud of. No excuses since I should be in the fast heat.

01/30/2016	00:00:00	Running	3.11	14:48.00	Competition 	Competition	BU Terrier 	5K Run	0		So this was bad, and it was my fault. Through 3k I was so in it! Felt like I was back at my best and hit 8:45 or something which was fine. Then it got a little harder, people started moving up and I turned into the Matt Walker who doubts himself and gives in. The last 10 laps were a sad excuse for a race. I need to smack myself in the head, no excuse to die off like that...I just fell out of sync. I am so close to getting back, though I should also stop holding myself to this high standard because it is only hurting me mentally. I remember running by the team and hearing come on Matt, break 15 and just thinking, has it really come to this? Better things to come at Valentine and NECs, also can't comment on others mentality when mine needs work too.<br /><br /><br />A good way to think of this is like my fitness is a loading bar, I'm 3/5 of the way loaded...just need to have patience and it will all come back. Plus I ran 14:57 at this meet the year I ran 30 flat in the 10k, so I'm surely progressing up quicker. This year may mirror that one somewhat.<br /><br /><br />Shout out to Alex on breaking 15 the first go around, and Bert with an exceptional freshman opener. Sean Ferguson also ran 8:06 today...nuff said there.

Finding out splits hurt me mentally. Felt better not looking at splits. On the last rep hit 29 mid through 200 which I realized was quick and shut down and closed on a 33. Still a good rep, but it is noteworthy. Decided on 3k at BU, and am excited for that.

Good workout, but felt harder than I think it should have, and harder than last week for sure. The pounding was getting to my legs more than anything.<br /><br /><br />Splits: Well as I look at my watch I seem to have deleted the splits, but we hit goal pace for pretty much all of it 52-54.

Just focused on staying on him and didn't look at laps until 6 to go. He dropped me eventually, and I was alone. Held out for second, and slowed down at the end since I had it locked.

02/20/2016	00:00:00	Running	3.11	14:50.00	Competition 	Competition	NEC Indoor Championship	5K Run	2		Went into this confident I could win being that Ferg had just run a hard mile. He took it out again and just never let up. 4:37 1600 and 8:46 through 3k. He dropped me at this point, and Gooding passed me as well. Held on and Gooding died per usual, once I realized this I picked up and passed him and pushed in for the finish. Definitely feeling the 3k during this. Time for a little rest, and then a nice close to my collegiate career.<br /><br /><br />Race video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88aymqbhTJQ

Felt a little rusty coming off of being sick, but really not bad at all other than the cough. The real issue was the fact that my balls were chaffing terribly by the 4th rep and got worse the faster I went, an embarrassing excuse for falling off Tyler and Bert, but its the truth.

At work Saturday the rep from trigger point came in and showed us to how to foam roll, and used me to demo manually massaging the soleus on it which hurt like a bitch, but I think it helped 2 days out from it.

Was going to stop at 10 as I felt beat, but was pissed and said screw it I'm finishing and going faster.<br /><br /><br />Felt terrible after. I don't get why this happens to me, seems more frequent lately too. Have IBS type stuff for hours immediately after, and my body feels sapped of all energy. Struggled to get to the cafe and get food. Now almost 3 hours later I still feel like shit. I hate this. I'm going to start taking supplements again. Will it help? I don't know, but I need to get in tip top shape quick so I'll do whatever it takes.<br /><br />

Just me and Kev doing a different workout. Hit alternating 70-71 for every rep other than a 72 on #25, a 68 on #29, and a 67 on #30. Felt way better than I assumed I would coming in. Mentally this was dare I say the easiest workout of the season? Yes, by far. Things are coming together, about 3 weeks to Mt. Sac. Time to keep sharpening up.

Then on loop 2 I picked up a bit and decided to run at whatever felt smooth. Decided not to push towards the end. For the circumstances...not bad.

Legs were tight and I fell back at first. Then Dave and I ran together and started the fast finish. I fell off him after about 20 minutes and my legs were having no part of it and I slowed down. Probably evened out to 15 miles honestly.

Only willing to take minimal x-training breaks.<br /><br /><br />I'm feeling very in tune with my running right now. Doing my thing, not worrying about anything but just getting out there and doing what I need to do. Excited to have some fun on Saturday. Need to break 14:45.

I felt so much better last Wednesday, but my legs were fatigued today. I think last week is still hitting me as I felt bad Sunday on the fast finish too. Went out alone the first 3, Alex came up on 4, he lead 5,6,7 and I came back for 8, he lead 9, then I lead 10 kind of.<br /><br /><br />Splits: Deleted them as they were unrepresentative, but went from 3:00 up to like 3:12 back down to 3:10, and finished on a 3:03.

Brought it out in 4:44, then the UMASS runner said he'd help me and take the next mile (that was so nice, surprised me tbh) then I proceeded to die off in a pathetic effort.<br /><br /><br />Fell so out of sync and was not in it once I realized I had fallen well off pace. Knew I wasn't going to hit IC4A qualifying. I could hear the disappointment in peoples voices as I fell off more and more.<br /><br /><br />I need to get my head in the game, and my legs back under me. Running very low on opportunities these days.

Was very pissed this morning, and since my legs didn't feel too bad today, I decided to lead the group on the run which has been rare for me. Picked up as we went until the res when it was just Blake and I.<br /><br /><br />Had some good conversation, which moved the second half along.<br /><br /><br />I think I am pressuring myself too much still. I tell myself if I don't hit a certain split, pace, or time that I suck and I am not living up to the high standards I told myself I would reach almost 2 years ago. Junior year I had no pressure and no expectations. Just went in and did the workouts,which were all great. Raced great each week, and was just so fulfilled by the running. This is starting off completely opposite, though some workouts have been very good (2/3 of the tempos, and the 30 x 400). The 30 x 400 I had just myself to pace with, and was far away from everything which I think took away any stress. I just need to relax and let things happen.

With Derek, Eric, Dave, and Jason. Lead the pace for a lot of it. Hit alternating 49-50 for all, and 48 for the last one. Felt way better than I thought, and noticed I could choose to run relaxed, or hard, 2 different types of effort and hit the same time either way. Got to get back to this relaxed running. Very much enjoyed this workout, glad we got away from the track.

Did a late run just because I wanted to. Enjoyed running at night, but did not enjoy the feel of the run. Ran Oak-Barbour-WML-back the same way.

Legs felt similar to yesterday, so nothing fast here again.<br /><br /><br />Seeds are out for Mt. Sac and I'm in the slow heat. This may work in my favor though being that I have not raced a 10k in nearly 2 years and don't know how it will feel. I'm the 7th seed out of like 50 something. Should stick to the front.<br /><br /><br /><br />

I kept holding on and moving with the pack. Then my left arch collapsed, and I pulled my calf. Couldn't run fast, and it all slipped away, wasted the biggest race of my life. I feel like one of those people who makes a dumb excuse for running bad, now I'll have to do this at IC4As... I'm not one to wallow in disappointment but damn, that hits hard, but I'll bounce back...I always make it happen.

Arch, outer leg, and calf all very sore, especially after this run. Still confused at what happened.<br /><br /><br />At the end of the day I really want to break 30 in the 10k, but if I don't its nothing to get to beat up over. I have 3 races left, 2 NECs, and 1 IC4As 10k, a fitting place to put it all out there. Received a job interview at Cigna today which also reinforced the fact that running isn't everything. I got a chance to run at one of the best meets in the country, and travel to California. Have to be grateful for that.

Got halfway there with Brittany and Joe who turned back at Dante's peak. Me and Blake continued to above the Hollywood sign which was like 55 min out plus a 5 minute hike where I stopped my watch because it was real technical. This run contained the best views I've seen in my life, just amazing. Made the fact that my leg and foot were still bothering me completely fine. They are worse after this and I was limping around, but I could not regret this run if I wanted to.

04/22/2016	08:00:00	Eliptical Trainer	0	1:10:00.00		Training					Elliptical, didn't go hard today so HR stayed in the 140s. Ran 2 100's on the track at the elementary school thing at the track, not good...not good. Hopefully it will be better tomorrow somehow.

05/07/2016	08:45:00	Running	6.22	32:04.00	Competition 	Competition	Outdoor NECs	10K Run	1		That was fun, finally a race I can be happy with.<br /><br /><br />Started at like a 5:14, then slowed way down as the kids up front were pacing so strange. Just hung on them with the boys. 5k was 16:46 I was told, closed in a 15:18 I guess. At 8 to go I made a strong move for 2 laps which dropped all but Bryce England and Alex, I told Alex to lead and he did one lap but ended up slowing a bit at 500 meters so I took back over and Bryce stayed right on me so I decided to pick it up more to try and drop him before it came down to 400 which is not my strong suit. Was able to do this and get the win. This has me confident again too which is great.<br /><br /><br />Alex, Tyler, and Bert got 3,5,6 so a strong showing from the distance squad out here. Overall a very good day with a bunch of breakout performances everywhere. Tomorrow will be fun.<br /><br /><br />Its the hunt.

05/08/2016	15:25:00	Running	3.11	15:34.00	Competition 	Competition	Outdoor NECs	5K Run	1		A satisfying conclusion to my NEC career. We as a team got 208 points...dude that is insane. Everyone came out to play on this team and I am so happy to see how well we came together.<br /><br /><br />As far as my 5k...great and it did wonders for me mentally. Went in telling myself that this was my race to win or lose. Went out with Russell Stevens leading like a dumb ass, throwing up hand signs and shit at his teammates while he lead, and then with 6 to go asking me if I wanted to lead...are you serious dude? Then Bryce England, who I give props too for running some great sophomore times asked me if I wanted to go now 100 meters later. I responded with a no. Then Alex moved up as he was antsy because the slow pace was kind of annoying. I took lead with 5 to go, and then at the mile...per coaches plan I picked up and ran a 68 where Bryce stayed on me, ran another 68 and he was still hanging. I then ran a 67 and he started falling off and closed in a 64. By this logic I ran about a 4:28 last mile to close. Very surprised by this. It wasn't easy, but I told myself if I kept pushing that Bryce would give in to it, which he did, and once he fell off a bit my confidence was too high to lose.<br /><br /><br />IC4As. I truly believe I can hit the regional standard if there are other kids going for it there. Can't wait to blow through these finals and get back to the track. The end is coming up fast.

05/13/2016	00:00:00	Running	6.22	30:30.00	Competition 	Competition	IC4A	10K Run	5		Wow I can't believe my athletic career is over. Teared up a bit after the race ended. What an amazing experience this has been. I have gained so much from XC and Track from high school to college besides PRs. Guess I'll never break that 30 min barrier. Not sure how I plan to continue with running from here on out...this is really weird. Hit up some road races? Take a normal break and get back to it? Take it down and just enjoy it? Got to think on this, but now I can do this my way which is kind of cool.<br /><br /><br />Can't leave this post without talking about my final race. I knew all week I was fatigued, no change today, just tried to ignore it. Hung on to the front until 10 to go where I finally fell off. Hit 30:30 which isn't a time I am happy to end on but this can't effect me, I'm done. Even if I went to regionals, it would still end. Oh well, it's been fun.<br /><br /><br />PRs at the end, every one other than 3k if from my JR it seems:<br /><br /><br />10k: 30:00.31 (IC4A JR)<br />5k: 14:29.09 (New Englands JR)<br />3k: 08:30 (NECs SR)<br />1 mile: 04:26 (Yale JR)<br />1500: 04:08 (CCSU home JR)

Worried I'd end up blowing up. 1 guy went out quick and died about 200 meters in and I was all alone. Basically held that pace,I was very cautious not too go too hard and blow up. Came to the final stretch and saw the clock at like 15:40. Was shocked as I wasn't feeling too tired, and picked up the pace a bit. Had I had a watch or time clock along the course I'd have broken 16. 2nd place was 17:13, an 18 year old with a state championship high school shirt on. I guess if I train a bit I can get fast pretty quick.<br /><br /><br />Legs have all kinds of pains after this...that's what happens!<br /><br /><br />Results:http://georesults.racemine.com/Bear-Foot-Sports/events/2016/2016-HILTON-HEAD-JINGLE-JINGLE-5K/results

04/27/2017	00:00:00	Running	4.5	34:43.00	Easy Run 	Training			0	ASICS DYNAFLYTE (04/13/2017)	This run sucked. Legs felt dead first off, and secondly my knee is acting up again. Its the insertion point of the patella, the tibial tubercuole. I'm going to actually try to fix this now.<br /><br /><br />I talked to one of the girls at work about it, and she said I have super tight calves and showed me how to really roll my quads.

I was running on Stanley St and went past a guy on the side walk and he just started running with me out of no where. I looked back at him and he kept looking forward with no expression, then he stopped and never said anything or made eye contact. So weird.<br /><br /><br />4 strides outside my apt (got to get race ready somehow)

I headed to CCSU to do a mile on the track to gauge things.<br /><br /><br />There was a soccer game and a goal in lanes 1-4 on the home straight so I had to weave every time. Felt way better than I thought it would...though 4:57 is nothing special, but I'll take it! Need to hold about 5:07 pace on race day to be back under 16.

The heat was far more brutal than anticipated and my legs were beat from walking around at work all day.No shirt weather is great tho.<br /><br /><br />Ran to Willow Brook Pk and around NBHS until I hit 21 minutes. Did 4x400 just to try to get a little speed in. Did like 75's and I was just beat in general. Ran a longer route back home to get another 21 minutes.

Caution I guess. Kate joined me for the race today, and made her goal, so proud!<br /><br /><br />Knee had no pain today during or after the race so a win there.<br /><br /><br />Lined up, had no real confidence. I tripped up to start and sprinted up to the kid who went out in front, he was running a decent pace and I had some negative thoughts, then within 800 meters he dropped and I gapped him. Fast course. I can run faster than this if I do another 5k. Would have been under 15:40 had the finish been more clear...minor gripe haha<br /><br /><br />Mile splits:<br />5:04<br />10:08 (5:04 again)<br />15:40 (5:32 for 1.1, 5:01 mile) *Course Record<br /><br /><br />Prizes:<br />$50<br />1 hour massage<br />1 month gym membership at Healthtrax<br />Waterbottle<br />Paper Pad<br />Sticky notes<br />Large trophy<br />Library Bag<br />1 free month at Big Sky (Kate won this)<br /><br /><br />Training continues!<br /><br />

Same idea as the last run.<br /><br /><br />Training has fallen apart again, nothing big but it disappoints me. Missed runs last week due to a friends personal problems hindering me.

Met up with Malcolm who had Courtney with him.<br /><br /><br />Lined up, got out in first not killing it, but soon enough Everett Hackett came up and went ahead of me increasing the pace. I held on for as long as I could. Splits were not technically good, but good for training. I got dropped a little after mile 1, and a bandit jumped in and passed me, helped having that guy there tho to have someone to look at.<br /><br /><br />Splits as I heard them yelled:<br /><br /><br />1 mile: 4:42 (woah did not expect that)<br />2 mile: 10:02 (5:20)(slight uphill, slowed)<br />3 mile: 15:19 (5:07)<br />5k: 15:39 (no legitimate kick to be had)<br /><br /><br />I'm pretty damn pleased with this. Harder course, fastest mile I have run in a real long time and still held out pretty well. Avg under 40 miles a week this month, no speed stuff besides a random 5:10 mile one time.
